# Idea Rank

Sometimes you have a lot of ideas that you're struggling to decide from; this is known as a "good problem".

If the indecision is slowing you down then that's not bueno.

This app forces you to compare them until you get to your top idea.

1. Make an `ideas.txt` file with one idea per line:

```
Thingymajig that transmogrifies Sploops
Nuclear microfilament launcher for rockets
Desks for cats
...
```

2. `go run main.go` to find the best one based on your own requirements.
