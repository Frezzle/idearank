# Idea Rank

Sometimes you have a lot of ideas that you're struggling to decide from; this is known as a "good problem".

If the indecision is slowing you down then that's not bueno.

This app forces you to compare them and until you get to your top idea.

1. Make an `ideas.txt` file with one idea per line:

```
Thingymajig that transmogrifies Sploops
Nuclear microfilament launcher for rockets
Desks for cats
...
```

2. `go run main.go` to find the best one based on your own requirements.
